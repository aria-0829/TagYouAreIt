# TagYouAreIt
 
This game project is built using the **MonoGame** application framework. 

- In this game, players take control of a sphere to tag cubes through direct touch. 
- The cubes will face and adhere to the sphere but will move away if the sphere approaches too closely. Upon successful tagging, the cubes will turn red. 
- A SpriteFont text in the corner displays the count of successfully tagged cubes.
